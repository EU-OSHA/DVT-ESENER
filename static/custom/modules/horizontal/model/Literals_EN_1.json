This is different from ESENER 2009 where <em>'the most senior manager who coordinates safety and health activities in this establishment'</em> was targeted. Additionally, in ESENER 2009, an interview with the workers' health and safety representative was aimed in those establishments where (1) a management interview was completed; (2) a formally designated representative with specific responsibility for the safety and health of workers existed; and (3) the management respondent had granted permission for the interview.</p>\n          <p>The main reason for the change was to get to the person who has the best knowledge about all health and safety issues, including details on risk assessment and other particular measures, regardless of their function or role in the establishment - which is asked anyway in a follow-up question.</p>\n             \n        <h2>Sampling strategy</h2>\n          <p>In order to ensure that the survey results are comparable cross-nationally, it is essential that the sampling strategy result in the same type of units being surveyed in each country. The quality of the available address registers varies across the participating countries in terms of:</p>\n          <ul>\n           <li>coverage (especially the sectors of activity included);</li>\n           <li>the availability and accuracy of the necessary background information (such as the sector of activity and number of employees).</li>\n          </ul>\n          <p>Existing address registers are not comparable among countries and therefore considerable efforts have been made to build samples that provide the necessary quality and ensure cross-national comparability. These efforts have required a screening procedure in those countries where the available address registers provide information at company rather than at establishment level.</p>\n          <p>Stratification of the sample is based on a matrix of four size classes and eight groups of sectors. While the general approach to sampling in the first two waves of ESENER was largely the same, there have been some changes over the years, particularly with respect to ESENER 2009.

However, almost all questions were modified between 2009 and 2014 and hence, trend analyses are possible from ESENER 2014 onwards. The development and revision of the ESENER questionnaire is done in close cooperation between EU-OSHA, the main ESENER contractor and a group of researchers on occupational health and safety from different countries, as well as EU-OSHA stakeholders.</p>\n          <p>The ESENER questionnaires have been subject to several tests:</p>\n\n          <ol type=\"a\" >\n            <li>A <strong>cognitive pre-test</strong> in Germany, Latvia and the Netherlands, with around 40 in-depth face-to-face interviews. The main aim of the cognitive pre-test is to check the understanding and clarity of the questions. There are also a number of cognitive questions aimed at testing whether respondents from different countries and different types of organisations interpret the standardised questions in the intended way and whether they are relevant to them. The cognitive pre-test usually leads to a number of modifications to the questionnaire.</li>\n            <li>A <strong>translatability assessment</strong> of the English master questionnaire version. Experienced translators from different language families elaborate rough translations of the draft master questionnaire in order to identify any ambiguities or other difficulties for translation. Where such difficulties are identified translators make proposals for alternative formulations for the master version, which is revised accordingly.</li>\n            <li>A <strong>pilot field test</strong> is carried out in all countries, with around 50 interviews per country. Using the same infrastructure as the main survey, this pilot test is done in the CATI mode (Computer Assisted Telephone Interviewing) but the option to participate online (CAWI: Computer Assisted Web Interviewing) is offered to those refusing to carry out the interview over the phone. The pilot field test results in a number of changes to the master questionnaire and to the individual national versions of the questionnaire.</li>\n          </ol>\n\n        <h2>Translation</h2>        \n          <p>Different national versions of the questionnaire are developed for the countries covered by the survey (available here: <a href=\"https://oshwiki.eu/wiki/ESENER-1_Methodology#Translation\" target=\"_blank\">ESENER 2009</a>, <a href=\"https://oshwiki.eu/wiki/ESENER-2_Methodology#Sample_sizes_and_questionnaire_language_versions\" target=\"_blank\">ESENER 2014</a> and ESENER 2019). An optimal translation strategy is essential to ensure that each national version of the questionnaire comprises high-quality questions that can be directed at all types of enterprise within the country concerned and generates information that can be compared cross-nationally. The translation of the ESENER questionnaire follows the TRAPD approach, an acronym for <em>Translation, Review, Adjudication, Pre-testing and Documentation</em> (Harkness, J. A. (2003). Questionnaire translation. In J. A. Harkness, F. van de Vijver, &amp; P. Ph. Mohler (Eds.), Cross-cultural survey methods (pp. 35-56). Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley &amp; Sons), except for the first wave (available here: <a href=\"https://oshwiki.eu/wiki/ESENER-1_Methodology#Translation\" target=\"_blank\">ESENER 2009</a>).</p>\n          <p>For languages shared by two or more countries, different national versions are developed, taking into account work-related practices such as worker representation or labour inspection, which require different questions and terminology. More details on the translation process can be found in the <a href=\"https://oshwiki.eu/images/0/01/Translation_Report.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Translation Report</a> - see below.</p>\n          <p>The basic steps included in the translation of ESENER are:</p>\n           \n          <ol type=\"1\" >\n            <li>Two independent translations into each of the languages carried out by professional translators - native speakers of the target language - who were not in contact with each other while producing their translation.</li>\n            <li>Review of the independent translations by an adjudicator, who drafts a new version.</li>\n            <li>Review meetings between the adjudicator and the two translators in order to jointly discuss the new draft and agree on a final adjudicated version.</li>\n            <li>Check of the adjudicated versions by EU-OSHA's <a href=\"https://osha.europa.eu/en/about-eu-osha/national-focal-points/focal-points-index\" target=\"_blank\">network of Focal Points</a>, with a specific focus on the national occupational safety and health (OSH) terminology, including the questions related to bodies of worker representation.</li>\n          </ol>\n\n        <h2>National sample sizes</h2>\n          <p>For the first time in ESENER 2014, national authorities were offered the possibility to fund an expansion of their national sample sizes. Spain, Slovenia and the United Kingdom took up the offer to boost their respective sample sizes. In ESENER 2019, three countries accepted this offer (Ireland, Norway and Slovenia), which this time included as well the possibility to add two to three questions of national interest to their respective questionnaires. Switzerland has fully funded all waves of ESENER.</p>\n           \n          <h3>Achieved sample sizes in ESENER</h3>         \n            \n            <table class=\"table table3\">\n
